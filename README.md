Python-based solutions to the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

## Utilities

I moved some common functions into the [utility](utility) directory.

### Constants

The [constants](utility/constants.py) file contains definitions of common mathematical constants not provided by `math`.

### Decorators

The [decorators](utility/decorators.py) file contains the decorators used to time the execution time of functions and print the return value from a function. This is mainly to remove messy repeated code.

### Maths functions

[math_f](utility/math_f.py) is a collection of mathematical functions.
